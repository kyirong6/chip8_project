### Team Members:
  1. Jiho Shin

# Testing Manual
We created a file called "test.html", which will take one opcode as an input to the emulator, here's a detailed step on how the testing works:
1. Open test.html file.
2. click on "Start".
3. Enter an opcode with prefix "0x".
4. the screen will then display the opcode, what has changed to the register and memory.

#Running Emulator
1. Open index.html file.
2. Click on File in top left corner and select Choose File.
3. Navigate to Chip8 file games 'CONNECT4' stored in chip8_project\src\components\games 
4. Program will then load and display memory usage on bottom right of screen if succesful.
5. Click start button to begin game.

#Connect 4 2 Player game
 *CONNECT4 USED FOR TESTING PURPOSES FOUND AT https://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8.html*
