# Testing Manual
We created a file called "chip8.test.js", which has the assertion function for testing the length of opcode, however, our opcode is not fully implemented, here's a detailed step on how the testing works:
1. Open index.html file.
2. right click, and click "Inspect".
3. click on "Console".
4. if it shows "true", then the test passes, otherwise it does not.


*this is just a generic readme. we will update and be more specific as we go along...*
