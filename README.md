# CHIP8 PROJECT
*cmpt 276 - software engineering*

### Description:
This project consists of building a **chip8 emulator**, a **visualizer** that shows various steps of program execution, a **tool** for chip8 developers, and **2 original chip8 games**.

### Team Members:
  1. Jiho Shin
  2. Gabriel Kwong

# Testing Manual
We created a file called "test.html", which will take one opcode as an input to the emulator, here's a detailed step on how the testing works:
1. Open test.html file.
2. click on "Start".
3. Enter an opcode with prefix "0x".
4. the screen will then display the opcode, what has changed to the register and memory.

#Running Emulator
1. Open index.html file
2. Click on File in top left corner and select Choose File
3. Navigate to Chip8 file default game 'CONNECT4' stored in chip8_project\src\components 
 *CONNECT4 USED FOR TESTING PURPOSES FOUND AT https://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8.html*
4. Program will then load and display memory usage on bottom right of screen if succesful


*this is just a generic readme. we will update and be more specific as we go along...*
