# CHIP8 PROJECT
*cmpt 276 - software engineering*

### Description:
This project consists of building a **chip8 emulator**, a **visualizer** that shows various steps of program execution, a **tool** for chip8 developers, and **2 original chip8 games**.

### Team Members:
  1. Jiho Shin
  2. Gabriel Kwong

# Testing Manual
We created a file called "chip8.test.js", which has the assertion function for testing the length of opcode, however, our opcode is not fully implemented, here's a detailed step on how the testing works:
1. Open index.html file.
2. right click, and click "Inspect".
3. click on "Console".
4. if it shows "true", then the test passes, otherwise it does not.

#Running Emulator
1. Open index.html file
2. Click on File in top left corner and select Choose File
3. Navigate to Chip8 file default game 'CONNECT4' stored in chip8_project\src\components 
 *CONNECT4 USED FOR TESTING PURPOSES FOUND AT https://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8.html*
4. Program will then load and display memory usage on bottom right of screen if succesful


*this is just a generic readme. we will update and be more specific as we go along...*
